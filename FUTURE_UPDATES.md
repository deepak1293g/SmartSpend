# SmartSpend v2.0 - Future Roadmap

This document outlines high-impact features and updates planned for future versions of the SmartSpend AI Financial Intelligence application. These updates aim to transform the app from a modern tracker into a true AI financial assistant.

## Planned Features

### 1. 🤖 AI Insights & Predictions
- **Smart Spending Alerts:** The system will analyze user spending patterns and provide proactive alerts (e.g., *"You have spent 30% more on 'Food' this week compared to the last."*).
- **Future Balance Prediction:** Utilize historical data to forecast an estimated end-of-month balance, helping users plan their savings.

### 2. 🧾 Smart Receipt Scanner (OCR Integration)
- **Zero Manual Entry:** Users can take a photo of a receipt or bill.
- **AI Extraction:** The app will use OCR and AI to automatically extract the **Amount**, **Date**, and **Category** from the image and pre-fill the transaction form.

### 3. 🎯 Budgets & Goals (Target System)
- **Category-Specific Limits:** Set monthly budget thresholds for individual categories (e.g., ₹5,000 for Food, ₹2,000 for Transport).
- **Visual Progress:** Implement dynamic progress bars showing how close a user is to their limit.
- **System Warnings:** Trigger a Matrix-themed "System Warning" notification when a user crosses 90% of their allocated budget.

### 4. 🔄 Recurring Transactions (Subscription Tracker)
- **Automated Logging:** Track fixed monthly/yearly expenses like Netflix, Gym Memberships, or House Rent.
- **Auto-Deduct:** Users set it up once, and the system automatically deducts/logs the transaction on the specified date without manual intervention.

### 5. 📁 Export & Reports (PDF/CSV)
- **One-Click Download:** Allow users to export their entire transaction history or filtered date ranges.
- **Formats:** Support PDF for visual reports and CSV/Excel for personal records or accounting (CA) purposes.

### 6. 🌗 Advanced Theming & Micro-Animations
- **Theme Engine:** In addition to the "Matrix Dark" theme, introduce options for a "Neo-Light" or "Cyberpunk Neon" aesthetic.
- **Sound Effects:** Add subtle, high-quality UI sound effects for successful transactions, warnings, and system alerts to enhance the futuristic feel.
